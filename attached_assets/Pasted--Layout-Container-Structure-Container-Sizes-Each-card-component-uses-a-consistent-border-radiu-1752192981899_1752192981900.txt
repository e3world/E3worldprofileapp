📌 Layout & Container Structure
Container Sizes:

Each card component uses a consistent border-radius of roughly 24px.

Padding inside cards is even, estimated at 24px - 32px from text/content to card edge.

Vertical spacing between sections within cards appears to be 16px - 24px.

Cards use a fixed width, likely around 320–360px for mobile or small viewport devices, with auto margin for horizontal centering.

Margins:

External margins around cards are likely 16px–24px top/bottom, and auto horizontally.

Consistent top margins between header text and content (~24px) within each card.

📌 Typography
Font Size:

Large headings (e.g. “Chris Alli”, “Connect with me”, “Question About me”):

Estimated at 24px–28px font size.

Bold weight, probably 600–700.

Subheadings (e.g. "Full time model and content creator", "Select an option below"):

Estimated at 16px–18px font size.

Regular weight (400–500).

Button text and form labels:

14px–16px font size.

Medium weight (500–600).

Line Height:

Heading line height: 1.2–1.4.

Body text and labels: 1.4–1.6 for readability.

Letter Spacing:

Generally normal to tight (likely 0 to -0.2px for headings to create a clean, modern look).

Button labels possibly use slight positive letter-spacing (+0.2px).

📌 Buttons & Form Controls
Button Sizing:

Height: Approximately 48px.

Border-radius: Consistent 24px for pill-shaped buttons.

Padding: 16px 24px inside buttons.

Dropdown & Input Fields:

Same button height (48px), ensuring UI consistency.

Border thickness estimated at 1–1.5px.

Dropdown indicator (chevron icon) sized proportionally at 16–20px.

Spacing:

Vertical space between input controls: 16px–20px.

Between button and input fields: 24px.

📌 Visual Hierarchy & Layout Flow
Clear visual hierarchy established through:

Larger, bold headings.

Medium-weight subtext.

Adequate spacing between elements.

Prominent, full-width buttons to guide interaction flow.

Grouping:

Elements logically grouped into card containers.

Related actions (playlist, social, book link) consistently styled and equally spaced.

Alignment:

All text and controls left-aligned within containers.

Button content (text and icon) aligned horizontally and centered within button bounds.

📌 Overall UX Observations
Layout is mobile-first responsive — consistent card widths, full-width controls.

High tap target areas — buttons and dropdowns exceed minimum recommended sizes (44x44px for mobile).

Clean visual hierarchy enables effortless content scanning.

Interactive elements follow a uniform design language, reducing cognitive load.
